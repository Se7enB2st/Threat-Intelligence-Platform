# Threat Intelligence Platform (MVP)

## Overview
The **Threat Intelligence Platform (MVP)** is a minimal viable product designed to aggregate and analyze cyber threat intelligence from key sources. It provides essential threat detection capabilities with a focus on simplicity, automation, and scalability.

## Core Features
- **Threat Aggregation:** Fetches intelligence from a few key sources such as VirusTotal and Shodan.
- **Basic Threat Analysis:** Identifies potential threats based on known indicators of compromise (IOCs).
- **Simple Web Interface:** Provides a lightweight dashboard for visualization and notifications.
- **Containerized Deployment:** Uses Docker for easy setup and scalability.
- **Cloud Readiness:** Deployable with Terraform on AWS/Azure/GCP.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python (FastAPI for API, Pandas for data processing)
- **Threat Intelligence Sources:** VirusTotal, Shodan
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for scalable storage
- **Containerization:** Docker for deployment
- **Infrastructure:** Terraform for cloud deployment

## Deployment
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Se7enB2st/Threat-Intelligence-Platform.git
   cd Threat-Intelligence-Platform
   ```
2. Set up the virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Set up PostgreSQL database:
   ```sh
   docker run --name postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=admin -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=admin -e POSTGRES_DB=threats_db -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
   ```
5. Deploy using Docker:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
6. Deploy to the cloud using Terraform:
   ```sh
   cd infrastructure
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

## Next Steps
- Expand data sources
- Implement machine learning-based threat correlation
- Add support for Elasticsearch
