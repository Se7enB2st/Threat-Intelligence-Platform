# Threat Intelligence Platform

## Overview
The **Threat Intelligence Platform** is designed to aggregate, analyze, and visualize cyber threat intelligence from various sources. It provides real-time insights and proactive defense mechanisms to enhance cybersecurity posture. This platform is built using **Python** and deployed as **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** to ensure scalability, automation, and easy deployment.

## Features
- **Threat Aggregation:** Collects intelligence from public and private sources, including APIs, feeds, and reports.
- **Real-Time Analysis:** Uses machine learning and data analytics to detect patterns and potential threats.
- **Dashboard & Alerts:** Provides a web-based dashboard for visualization and real-time threat notifications.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Automates deployment using **Terraform/Ansible** for cloud infrastructure management.
- **Scalability & Automation:** Designed for cloud-native environments with containerization support (Docker/Kubernetes).

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python (Flask/FastAPI for API, Pandas/Numpy for data processing)
- **Threat Intelligence Sources:** OpenCTI, VirusTotal, Shodan, AlienVault OTX, MISP
- **Database:** PostgreSQL / Elasticsearch for storing and indexing threat intelligence data
- **Infrastructure:** Terraform, Ansible, AWS/Azure/GCP for cloud deployment
- **Containerization:** Docker, Kubernetes for scaling and orchestration
- **Logging & Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack

## Deployment
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/threat-intel-platform.git
   cd threat-intel-platform
   ```
2. Set up the virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Configure environment variables in `.env` file.
5. Deploy using Docker:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
6. Deploy to the cloud using Terraform:
   ```sh
   cd infrastructure
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

## Future Enhancements
- AI-powered threat correlation and prediction
- Integration with SIEM and SOAR platforms
- Multi-cloud deployment support
